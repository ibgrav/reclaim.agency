  <p>What will long outlive coal plants are the contaminants they leave behind, in both our environments and our bodies.
    High-sulfur coal, common to the east, is washed with water to meet environmental regulations, the byproducts of
    which are often left in wastewater ponds (aka, slurry reservoirs). More than 700 such reservoirs exist in Appalachia
    alone, containing hundreds of millions of gallons of mine waste which can easily seep into surface and groundwater

    the exponentially higher warming potential of methane than CO2 which is being rapidly released by thawing permafrost
    (global permafrost contains twice as much carbon as exists in the atmosphere today). I am clearly not a scientist,
    so as I have learned about the limitations of climate models and the impossible task of accounting for the

    Oscillation, and the implications of unprecedented warming in the stratosphere. Questions on Thermohaline

    oceans absorb, before all systems are thrown off? The prediction that summer sea ice in the Arctic will be
    non-existent by 2050, exposing the dark ocean which will absorb even more of the sun’s heat. The list goes on (and

    Including this in the narrative is to acknowledge the very real possibility of solar geoengineering via
    Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), especially as it gains traction in mainstream climate action conversations.
    Kevin Surprise posits that leading centers of SAI research, such as the Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research
    Program (HSGRP), “construct the ‘necessity’ of research, experimentation, and potential deployment under ideological
    pretenses aimed at maintaining the hegemony of liberal-capitalism.” He sees SAI under HSGRP as a “form of
    imperialism rather than a tool for climate justice.” Surprise, Kevin. “Stratospheric Imperialism: Liberalism,
    (Eco)Modernization, and Ideologies of Solar Geoengineering Research:” Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space,
    April 18, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1177/2514848619844771.
    There is only so much we can learn from simulations, and there is no testing SAI. We have one global atmosphere. If
    SAI is deployed, earth’s inhabitants will be the guinea pigs. Who gets to decide if and when this will happen? The
    dialectic between the IPCC’s recent executive summary and emergent specious technologies is of particular interest
    at this critical moment in human history. Reliance on existing infrastructures in the context of today’s climate
    crisis is a version of moral hazard whereby people will not alter behaviors under the belief that their risks will
    be mitigated by technological innovation. It recalls historian Donald Worster’s inception of an infrastructure trap:
    once a society commits a certain amount of resources to solving a problem in a particular way, those choices become
    a straitjacket, making it difficult to think about or address problems in any other way. Technology is not our
    savior. (still need to cite but seriously can’t find).

  <p>Managed retreat or rapid relocation will likely happen more frequently in the future. How can communities prepare
    for this collectively? It may depend on the type of disaster - slow or fast. Slow may be toxic industry or rising
    tides in which case people have more time to plan for strategic obsolescence of compromised infrastructure and
    support relocation over time. Fast disasters however, like wildfires, will require immediate evacuation followed by
    the question of whether or not to rebuild. We saw this firsthand with Paradise in 2018 (add link). The loss of place
