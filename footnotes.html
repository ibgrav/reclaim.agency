    <p>Repetitive Loss Properties that have been damaged and rebuilt multiple times using federal flood insurance
      payouts have cost the government, and taxpayers, more than $12.1 billion already. Policy reform that prioritizes
      the highest risk, lowest resource communities could address social inequities before they worsen along with the
      storms. Siders, A. R. “Government-Funded Buyouts after Disasters Are Slow and Inequitable – Here’s How That Could
      Change.” The Conversation. Accessed April 25, 2020.

  <p>We have already experienced storms beyond the 5 category Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Whether we deem them
    category 6 or not, future superstorms will increase the risk of public health crises and pandemics (like the one we
    are currently living through, but far worse and far more frequently).</p>

  <p>While there are many contested estimates for Sea Level Rise, I am using data from a recently published coastal risk
    screening tool, whose findings fall in a middle ground between most other sources I have reviewed. They show nearly
    150 million people currently living on land that will be below the high-tide line by 2050. Lu, Denise, and
    Christopher Flavelle. “Rising Seas Will Erase More Cities by 2050, New Research Shows.” The New York Times, October

  <p>Envisioning a 2050 worth fighting for means asking difficult questions in our communities now, especially for those
    living in coastal regions. The question of whether to stay or go should be made collectively and with intention and
    agency by those communities facing the permanent loss of places they call home. It should be made democratically on
    a case-by-case basis, as the people experiencing forced displacement are best equipped to ensure the places dear to
    them live on regardless of physical location. Managed retreat, defined by AR Siders as “the purposeful movement of
    people and infrastructure out of vulnerable floodplains” is one of numerous adaptation strategies, none of which are
    mutually exclusive. A number of existing relocation programs are embedded in inequities, especially when government
    officials are deciding where to acquire properties for relocation. Government buyouts “have significant potential
    social justice implications, as [they] could promote or reduce existing social inequities.” Siders, A.R. “Social
    Justice Implications of US Managed Retreat Buyout Programs.” Climatic Change Online (2018).</p>

  <p>Managed retreat or rapid relocation will likely happen more frequently in the future. How can communities prepare
    for this collectively? It may depend on the type of disaster - slow or fast. Slow may be toxic industry or rising
    tides in which case people have more time to plan for strategic obsolescence of compromised infrastructure and
    support relocation over time. Fast disasters however, like wildfires, will require immediate evacuation followed by
    the question of whether or not to rebuild. We saw this firsthand with Paradise in 2018 (add link). The loss of place
    and home is devastating, yet the burning of ______ creates toxic sites like Minden. Tough questions that should be
    addressed.</p>
