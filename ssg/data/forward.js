    p: "The stories we tell ourselves, about both our public and private pasts, determine so much of how we will show up for the present. How we interpret experiences has a profound impact on our capacity for both agency and compassion, and subsequently our personhood. The relationship between agency and victimhood is a nuanced one, and how we live our lives may be determined by the lens through which we view our own narrative and the ways in which we tell those stories."

    p: "The narratives we construct around our own experiences not only constitute the deeply personal epistemological scaffolding which come to inform our worldviews, but also the lens through which we view that very world. The capacity to interpret, assimilate, and often cope with past experiences holds great bearing on the way in which we move through the present and what we are able to conceive as possible for the future. This has profound implications for both our individual and collective lives, and thus our ability to engage embodied change and sustained transformation on a societal level. In order to enact equitable, pluralistic, and reparative futures, we must first believe they are possible. In this effort, the importance in politicizing trauma{1} is paramount given the immediate threat climate change and systemic violence pose to frontline communities{2}. “Enacting Just Futures” examines urgent questions3 about the human condition in crisis through storytelling. “Enacting Just Futures” takes the form of a screenplay; a speculative and visionary fiction{4} that seeks to empower adaptive agency in order to collectively enact a new world order{6}. I use fiction as a means to challenge the relationships between crypto-colonialism{7}, capitalism, and climate change that systematically subjugate communities that do not subscribe to their ideologies{8}."
