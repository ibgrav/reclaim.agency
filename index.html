                     <h3>“One of the functions of art is to give people the words to know their own experience. Storytelling is a tool for knowing who we are and what we want.” <br />- Ursula K. Le Guin </h3>
                     <p>The stories we tell ourselves, about both our public and private pasts, determine so much of how we will show up for the present. How we interpret experiences has a profound impact on our capacity for both agency and compassion, and subsequently our personhood. The relationship between agency and victimhood is a nuanced one, and how we live our lives may be determined by the lens through which we view our own narrative and the ways in which we tell those stories. </p>
                     <p>The narratives we construct around our own experiences not only constitute the deeply personal epistemological scaffolding which come to inform our worldviews, but also the lens through which we view that very world. The capacity to interpret, assimilate, and often cope with past experiences holds great bearing on the way in which we move through the present and what we are able to conceive as possible for the future. This has profound implications for both our individual and collective lives, and thus our ability to engage <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://generativesomatics.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Copy-of-What-is-a-politicized-somatics.pdf">embodied change</a> and sustained transformation on a societal level. In order to enact equitable, pluralistic, and reparative futures, we must first believe they are possible. In this effort, the importance in politicizing trauma<sup><a id="fw-1-src" href="#fw-1">1</a></sup> is paramount given the immediate threat climate change and systemic violence pose to frontline communities<sup><a id="fw-2-src" href="#fw-2">2</a></sup>. “Enacting Just Futures” examines urgent questions<sup><a id="fw-3-src" href="#fw-3">3</a></sup> about the human condition in crisis through storytelling. “Enacting Just Futures” takes the form of a screenplay; a speculative and visionary fiction<sup><a id="fw-4-src" href="#fw-4">4</a></sup> that seeks to empower adaptive agency<sup><a id="fw-5-src" href="#fw-5">5</a></sup> in order to collectively enact a new world order<sup><a id="fw-6-src" href="#fw-6">6</a></sup>. I use fiction as a means to challenge the relationships between crypto-colonialism<sup><a id="fw-7-src" href="#fw-7">7</a></sup>, capitalism, and climate change that systematically subjugate communities that do not subscribe to their ideologies<sup><a id="fw-8-src" href="#fw-8">8</a></sup>. </p>
                     <p>A society’s capacity to usefully integrate tragic compassion<sup><a id="fw-9-src" href="#fw-9">9</a></sup> as a structural tenet hinges upon philosopher Martha Nussbaum’s insight that “people are dignified agents, but they are also, frequently, victims”. That victimization, catalyzed by environmental degradation, will become rampant for millions<sup><a id="fw-10-src" href="#fw-10">10</a></sup> as we enter an age of unprecedented insecurity<sup><a id="fw-11-src" href="#fw-11">11</a></sup> in a truly anthropogenic era where no part of earth - whether directly or indirectly - has been untouched by the impact of mankind<sup><a id="fw-12-src" href="#fw-12">12</a></sup>. In order for those most disenfranchised to be treated with dignity, the collective narrative for activists seeking to dismantle systems of oppression needs to shift from resilience<sup><a id="fw-13-src" href="#fw-13">13</a></sup> to resistance - we cannot keep asking the same vulnerable communities to absorb the risks and costs of this crisis. </p>
                     <h3>“Can we really not imagine anything better?”</h3>
                     <p>This question was first posed to me last spring by <u>Collette Pichon Battle</u> in a lecture on Leadership in Environmental Conflicts. It is one that I have since envisioned as the call to action of my graduate studies; one that requires both a realistic assessment of current political and economic systems, and a radical revisioning of what they could be. Addressing this question as a society will require organized, empathic leadership that promotes purposeful experimentation and prioritizes a just and inclusive process. In order for this undertaking of transformative justice to be successful, we will not only need creative strategies and tactics, but public narratives that inspire action in the face of uncertainty--ones that inspire <b>hope</b>. Hope alongside grief, fear, and anger - because all of those things coexist. Collette Pichon Battle’s lecture highlighted the failures of our collective moral imagination that have perpetuated oppressive, hegemonic systems through complacency. We have not been living by the question - <em>can we not imagine anything better?</em> </p>
                     <p>We are surrounded by evidence of tremendous suffering, yet too often those with the ability to create positive change are complacent or impaired by empathic distress rather than striving to embody radical hope. I take inspiration from activist-scholars such as Rebecca Solnit, who reframe ideas of hope in terms of transformative solidarity that requires action. Transformative away from the status quo rather than reactionary and protective of it. This piece is about the self-work of interrogating our own narratives, ones where we may play the role of bystander or victim, to become agents of change for ourselves and our communities. Personal and societal transformation is inseparable. We need to build our capacity to hold that complexity while organizing together. Can modeling generative conflict through empathic storytelling lead to collective action? Imagined scenarios that invite readers to look beyond individual experience to interrogate the social, political, and economic roots of trauma<sup><a id="fw-14-src" href="#fw-14">14</a></sup>? This piece attempts to build an imperfect world<sup><a id="fw-15-src" href="#fw-15">15</a></sup> that we can not only hope for, but realistically work towards. We cannot move on to envisioning radically different social configurations and material flows without confronting the colonial legacies we inherited and perpetuate in the daily productions of our lives. </p>
                     <h3>“Transform yourself to transform the world.”<br />- Grace Lee Boggs</h3>
                     <p>My personal trauma and socialization have led me to believe that I am inherently <em>wrong</em>: my ideas are wrong, my emotions are wrong, my personhood is wrong. Invalid, irrelevant, unimportant. I put tremendous effort into believing that my opinions and emotions are equally as valid as those of the next person, but my depression and anxiety warn me otherwise. My unstable upbringing led to a belief that I am incapable of grasping concepts that seem obvious to everyone else around me; a belief which is amplified in settings where people are posturing and constantly claiming space (i.e. Harvard and Movement spaces in general). Taking up any amount of space feels dangerous to me, and sometimes when I speak my mind or assert a claim my body reacts as if I am in physical danger even if my mind knows better. Pragmatism and reparenting can only take me so far when I walk into a room not only believing these things about myself, but being convinced that every other person has the same assumption. I bring this up because this deep-seated fear has been a barrier to engaging with activism broadly. In part, I have not known what I have to offer; a sense of self doubt that has heightened in organizing spaces where burnout is high and patience is low<sup><a id="fw-16-src" href="#fw-16">16</a></sup>. Spaces of resistance have sometimes felt just as siloed and exclusionary as academia. There is also a sense of self-sacrifice and martyrdom associated with committing one's life to the revolution that has further complicated my relationship with activism. What are the ways to find joy and the ability to be present despite a societal expectation that suffering is inherent to justice work and success? </p>
                     <p>My views on this shifted after reading adrienne maree brown. Her latest book, Pleasure Activism: The Politics of Feeling Good, has convinced me that changing the world doesn’t just have to be another form of work, but rather can be regenerative, healing, and pleasurable. She posits that we settle for suffering and self-negation because of oppression; that oppression makes us believe that pleasure (for me, happiness without fear or shame) is not something that we all have equal access to. In order for activism to be sustainable, it must be generative, inclusive, and more than that, imaginative of a more just future which does not further replicate the fissures of the status quo. Movement should feel satisfying; a relationship between what we have to offer and what the Movement needs from us. Adrienne has taught me that misery and Movement shouldn’t feel synonymous. That is the sweet spot we should strive to occupy--the one that precludes the voice of doubt that tells us we have nothing to offer, or that what we have to offer isn’t enough. In order to find that sweet spot, we have to establish boundaries alongside our politicization and build our capacity for love and rigor <em>simultaneously</em><sup><a id="fw-17-src" href="#fw-17">17</a></sup>. Logic alone doesn’t change behavior; an emotional call to action is necessary to push forward a new social philosophy. We cannot make moral decisions without emotional information - if we cannot experience emotion, we cannot experience values that orient us to the choices we must make<sup><a id="fw-18-src" href="#fw-18">18</a></sup>. As Angela Davis says, “the revolution must be irresistible.” </p>
                     <p>Cultivating self-knowledge is a prerequisite to empathy and living in community. Complexity of character<sup><a id="fw-19-src" href="#fw-19">19</a></sup> and personhood is often flattened and made dichotomous by identity politics and the reductive nature of the roles we play (or that are assigned to us). Liberating ourselves from these identity traps is necessary in order to facilitate sustainable momentum in the face of crisis and injustice. This should happen through an individual and communal healing process that prioritizes those who have been generationally oppressed<sup><a id="fw-20-src" href="#fw-20">20</a></sup>. Organizing for this movement should be a liberatory practice and an act of resistance that allows our visions and our values to align over time. ”Enacting Just Futures” seeks to play a role in collectively growing our capacity for hope in order to organize against further oppression and cultivate communities of care. </p>
                     <h3>“There is nothing radical about moral clarity”<br />Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</h3>
                     <p>In order to craft the screenplay as a call-to-action for enacting just futures, I looked to the framework and organizing principles of the Green New Deal (GND)<sup><a id="fw-21-src" href="#fw-21">21</a></sup>. Over the past 2 years we have witnessed the unveiling of equitable and inclusive climate policy in the form of the GND, spearheaded in the states by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/green-new-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sunrise Movement</a> and by many others abroad. </p>
                     <p>The GND is a departure from previous climate policy in that it addresses the roles of multiple systems and institutions in creating and perpetuating the global climate crisis. It assigns blame directly<sup><a id="fw-22-src" href="#fw-22">22</a></sup> and provides adaptable paths forward<sup><a id="fw-23-src" href="#fw-23">23</a></sup> against incrementalism, austerity, and concentrated wealth and ownership. It explicitly rejects logics of perpetual growth and extraction that are ingrained in the foundational institutions and practices that determine how wealth is produced and distributed. It acknowledges that moving beyond market fundamentalism will require deep structural shifts - not only in how the economy is organized, but in what is perceived as possible in the dominant social imaginary. </p>
                     <p>I believe in a necessarily radical global Green New Deal. <em>Radical</em> in its <u>swift</u> and dramatic departure from business-as-usual and in its recognizing (and uplifting) the undervalued labor of care<sup><a id="fw-24-src" href="#fw-24">24</a></sup>. With COVID-19 and state efforts to ‘return to normal’, we are living through a historic moment that has exposed clearly that ‘normal’ for most of the global population is a constant state of crisis. It has exposed the politics of preordained inequality and predatory economics that have so tragically exacerbated not only the coronavirus crisis, but every pre existing inextricable crisis that undergirds it. </p>
                     <p>COVID-19 presents an awakening from the hypnosis of normality. Isolation during the pandemic has felt like the eye of a storm at times. A familiar vantage point as someone who grew up in Florida with hurricanes rather than snow days in my childhood. That calm window presents an opportunity to assess the damage while awaiting the storm’s imminent, unstoppable second wave. The next wave is on our horizon, and the impacts of systemic breakdown in the midst of this pandemic are incomprehensible without storytelling. We are in the eye of a storm. Will we succumb to an insidious ethos of individualism, or forge new trajectories of connection and support? </p>

                  <p>The self is constructed by our experiences, and thus our trauma. So much of how I situate myself in my life, but especially in academia and spaces of activism, is tied up in embodied survival strategies that determine how I react in moments of uncertainty. Some reactions are so embedded that they are impossible to see; we are blinded by our own subjectivity. I look to Movement leader Staci K. Haines’ definition of trauma as it resonates most clearly with my own experiences and the false tradeoffs trauma presents. “Trauma is an experience, series of experiences, and/or impacts from social conditions, that break or betray our inherent need for safety, belonging, and dignity. They are experiences that result in us having to vie between these inherent needs, often setting one against the other. For example, it might leave us with the impact of “I can be safe but not connected (isolated),” or “I have to give up my dignity to be safe or connected.” This is untenable, because all of these needs are constitutive or inherent in us.” Haines, Staci. <em>The Politics of Trauma: Somatics, Healing, and Social Justice</em>.

                  <p>Nussbaum looks to Greek tragedies to explain the development of compassion through lessons on the connection of common humanity. My simple interpretation: bad things happen to good people. Those bad things can never strip a person of their humanity and dignity. Nussbaum’s compassion requires discernment - “Tragedy asks us, then, to walk a delicate line. We are to acknowledge that life’s miseries strike deep, striking to the heart of human agency itself. And yet we are also to insist that they do not remove humanity, that the capacity for goodness remains when all else has been removed.” This false binary between agent and victim is a hallmark of American life.

                  <p>Forced migration due to violence, land degradation/loss of livelihood, and climate change are examples of sociocultural and climatic events that leave their physical and psychological marks on places and the individuals who endure them. They are not only collective traumas but cumulative traumas in that they have detrimental and additive impacts on one’s mental and physical wellbeing over time. Displacement is not in the future. It is the reality for <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over half a million Americans</a> and <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70.8 million</a> refugees worldwide. For so many families a shifting climate is what uproots their lives. Whether indirectly through land degradation, desertification, and job and resource scarcity (or designed scarcity rather) or more explicitly through acts of violence, severe weather events, environmental racism, and land grabbing. Most of these refugees (58%) are not in camps or rural areas, but rather in cities(where the hell did i find this??). With capitalism in direct opposition to the climate, these trends will only increase. In fact, although the most widely cited estimate for global climate refugees by 2050 is <a href="https://www.iom.int/migration-and-climate-change\" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 million</a>, the forecasts range up to <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/climate-migrants-might-reach-one-billion-2050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion</a>.

                  <p>Like the Just Transition, there are many contested definitions for a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green New Deal</a> (and even more for a global Green New Deal). In short, it is a climate proposal that seeks to rapidly decarbonize the economy while dismantling racial, class, and gender inequalities. It envisions doing so by creating millions of jobs which prioritize disenfranchised communities while ensuring universal public services like Medicare for All, free education through college and free childcare. For the sake of brevity, I will quote my favorite long-view explanation: “We hope that confronting climate change will also be the occasion for breaking from capitalism. We see the Green New Deal, like its namesake, less as a particular suite of policies than as a multi-decade effort to write a more humane, sustainable, and democratic social contract. But whereas the New Deal ultimately saved capitalism for capitalists, we aspire to channel a new wave of mass mobilisation in a more radical direction.” “For a Global Green New Deal.” Accessed May 3, 2020. https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/reports/for-a-global-green-new-deal. </p>

Each is carrying a child’s blow up innertube over their shoulder, one with a six pack of beer. Trash sparsely populates the water which is glistening with oil and runoff. In front of them, a narrow patch of the water is bubbling as if over rapids, but really this is the area of Domino Park with run-through water jets for kids to cool off in during grueling summers like this one. The rainbow lights from the jets are creating iridescent currents with the oil. There had been heavy rain for the past three days that had finally let up. The high tide came with the full moon making the flooding even worse. A huge red orb illuminating the whole haunting scene.</span><span>The teens find a spot beneath one of the gantry lifts and post up. The boy takes off his belt and uses it to attach the two innertubes together in case a current comes along while the girl secures their backpacks on a brace at the base of the crane. They plop down fully clothed into their innertubes, each crack a beer, and cheers. MUSIC FADES LOWER.</span>

                <p>&nbsp;-- If you’re full up with climate anxiety, go ahead and skip this footnote. --<br />Accelerated feedback loops - an infinite domino effect of amplified impacts of climate factors - are what perhaps scare me most. One accelerator is the exponentially higher warming potential of methane than CO2 which is being rapidly released by thawing permafrost (global permafrost contains twice as much carbon as exists in the atmosphere today). I am clearly not a scientist, so as I have learned about the limitations of climate models and the impossible task of accounting for the interconnectedness of all our living systems I have come to more questions than answers. Questions about Arctic Oscillation, and the implications of unprecedented warming in the stratosphere. Questions on Thermohaline Circulation, and the implications of the gulf stream slowing down. How much more heat from the atmosphere can the oceans absorb, before all systems are thrown off? The prediction that summer sea ice in the Arctic will be non-existent by 2050, exposing the dark ocean which will absorb even more of the sun’s heat. The list goes on (and on and on and on). Don’t follow me down this rabbit hole unless you’re a masochist. In that case go ahead and read the infamous 5th IPCC report in its entirety. </p>

She burns herself taking it out and throws it in the sink, turns on the water and steam rushes up, mixing with smoke from oven. Man stomps in from back room and yells; Jules yells back.

                  <p> Including this in the narrative is to acknowledge the very real possibility of solar geoengineering via Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), especially as it gains traction in mainstream climate action conversations. Kevin Surprise posits that leading centers of SAI research, such as the Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program (HSGRP), “construct the ‘necessity’ of research, experimentation, and potential deployment under ideological pretenses aimed at maintaining the hegemony of liberal-capitalism.” He sees SAI under HSGRP as a “form of imperialism rather than a tool for climate justice.” Surprise, Kevin. “Stratospheric Imperialism: Liberalism, (Eco)Modernization, and Ideologies of Solar Geoengineering Research:” Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space, April 18, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1177/2514848619844771. There is only so much we can learn from simulations, and there is no testing SAI. We have one global atmosphere. If SAI is deployed, earth’s inhabitants will be the guinea pigs. Who gets to decide if and when this will happen? The dialectic between the IPCC’s recent executive summary and emergent specious technologies is of particular interest at this critical moment in human history. Reliance on existing infrastructures in the context of today’s climate crisis is a version of moral hazard whereby people will not alter behaviors under the belief that their risks will be mitigated by technological innovation. It recalls historian Donald Worster’s inception of an infrastructure trap: once a society commits a certain amount of resources to solving a problem in a particular way, those choices become a straitjacket, making it difficult to think about or address problems in any other way. Technology is not our savior. (still need to cite but seriously can’t find). </p>

                <p>Managed retreat or rapid relocation will likely happen more frequently in the future. How can communities prepare for this collectively? It may depend on the type of disaster - slow or fast. Slow may be toxic industry or  rising tides in which case people have more time to plan for strategic obsolescence of compromised infrastructure and support relocation over time. Fast disasters however, like wildfires, will require immediate evacuation followed by the question of whether or not to rebuild. We saw this firsthand with Paradise in 2018 (add link). The loss of place and home is devastating, yet the burning of ______ creates toxic sites like Minden. Tough questions that should be addressed.</p>

                     <p>Well his dad, Papa Lencho, was a Mixtec farmer. Used to work super closely with Jesús León Santos on a land renewal program (sips tea, pulls her hair behind her ears). They were working to reclaim and regenerate depleted land through the reintegration of indigenous farming practices in a region that used to have one of the highest soil erosion rates in the world (x)<sup><a id="sp-37-src" href="#sp-37">37</a></sup>. </p>

                     <p><span>MAREN</span>Was also raised as a Mixtec farmer, but with the rates of desertification and migration, he decided to study environmental law. He ended up getting accepted to UNAM (add footnote on free education?) and graduated in 2015, I think?

She had just been adopted by him and her Uncle Wyatt the summer before returning for 7th grade, and this updo was Wyatt’s best attempt at hairdressing. She missed getting her hair braided by her mom, but Sebas’ kerchief brought her some comfort on this first day of school in a new place.</span><span>She met Jaye during their urban farming class. Their school had dug up the adjacent parking lot and remediated the soil beneath it, but still used raised planter beds to be safe. Maren was sitting on the edge of one, staring mindlessly at two squirrels chasing each other up a London Planetree when Jaye kicked her sneaker. He had her same hair, but his was held at bay with a sports headband. He was unreasonably tall for a 13 year old and you could tell that he was outgrowing his clothes faster than his caretakers could get ahold of new ones.

He couldn’t see a thing; wasn’t even sure if he had eyes, yet somehow it felt like a million eyes were on him. His psyche searched for some logical scape that could produce this pressure and cavernous effect simultaneously. Was he in space? At the bottom of the ocean? He realized he couldn’t breathe and started to panic. He perceived something in the periphery. Was that a light? The faint glow was bobbing towards him, growing. Quickly. Hope, then dread. Was it one of those wild light bulb fish 1,000 meters under the sea approaching with her bioluminescent lure? Or some cosmic ray beyond earth’s atmosphere? He was debating which would be worse, complete isolation or becoming fish food when the pressure changed directions. He couldn’t tell you which, he had no sense, but it was emanating from the light whatever that meant. He felt fractured into a million pieces and sensed that all those “eyes” around him, whatever they were, had also exploded from the pressure. They were all mixing together in some primordial gaseous soup, now floating upwards towards a new light as if being abducted. By what? He could see again.</span> </div>

In “Crisis by Design: A Brief Review of US Farm Policy,” Mark Ritchie and Kevin Ristau describe the parity system as extremely successful: Farmers received fair prices for their crops, production was controlled to prevent costly surpluses, and consumer prices remained low and stable. At the same time, the number of new farmers increased, soil and water conservation practices expanded dramatically, and overall farm debt declined. Current subsidies fail to that purportedly compensate for constantly falling farm prices, but really only subsidize the big processors, vertically integrated livestock factories, and international traders, family-scale farms need a system of fair pricing, that is, prices that cover the real costs of living and farming, including conservation practices that regenerate natural resources.“Why Sustainable Agriculture Should Support a Green New Deal.” CounterPunch.org, January 16, 2019. https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/01/16/why-sustainable-agriculture-should-support-a-green-new-deal/. </p>

                     <p><span>JAYE</span>It felt like a fever dream, it was surreal. I couldn’t wrap my head around it last night, but. I think I was shale. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>Like, rock? Not to diminish but that sounds about as tame a nightmare as possible. </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>No no, I mean yes but. I was me... I was... fossilized. We all were, humans I mean. I think we were the new fossil fuel, I think I was being fracked. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>That is next level terrifying.</p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>Yea I don’t know who or what was fracking us... definitely the equivalent of a deadline anxiety leading up to the announcement. But it does make me think. Of all the ways the currents of consumerism have flooded around barriers and through gaps. How much we are still missing the point. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>(lifts legs and rotates to extend them on the bench seat) The point of?</p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>(copies Maren in the opposite direction on his own bench seat, they do a forward fold in unison to stretch) The point of community. The point of uplifting the alternatives and the ideas of people instead of just the innovation of technology. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>I am - <span>(cocks her head pensively) </span>- not disagreeing, but wouldn’t we not have reached this milestone without technology? I think strangely I have always perceived technology in tandem with my anxiety. They are kind of the same beast in my imagination. </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>How is that a good thing??</p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>I mean... I think of my anxiety as a permanent fixture, like that leaking faucet. (nods towards sink) </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>I thought I’d fixed that...</p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>I mean, maybe that’s my point? Temporary fixes keep full breaks at bay, but the incessant drip returns. And it doesn’t matter if you are listening for it or not, cause you’re in the echo chamber. But what would I do without it to keep pace? </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>You don’t always have to keep pace, Maren. Feel like I’ve been telling you that since we were kids. Not everything is a competition. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>It’s not about winning, or at least not against someone? It’s more for my own sanity. I think I need my anxiety to keep up, keep going. I don’t know what I’d be without it. Don’t know that I would ever accomplish anything without it. </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>Accomplish what though? I don’t know whose standard of success you’re living by, Mar. It’s all self-policing. Antifa<sup><a id="sp-51-src" href="#sp-51">51</a></sup>, get that shit out of your head. We are post debt<sup><a id="sp-52-src" href="#sp-52">52</a></sup>. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>We’re not though... I mean, it lives on. I don’t know how to explain it. It feels inherited. </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>Not from Wyatt, you didn’t. That man’s classroom was an organizing space of resistance. He was the resistance. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>I don’t mean him, or just him. And you know it’s not that simple... I think both my dads carried... still carry the weight and fear of raising a child in a capitalist society. Of myriad oppressions. </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>Yes, I hear you, I promise I am listening BUT (spreading his arms for scale and affect) we outlived capitalism. That’s what today is about, be happy with me. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN</span>You are the one having future fracking fever dreams! And it doesn’t so much matter that we are post debt... it’s just taken another form. Debt’s just the promise of future time, onto the next deadline. IOU forever. I never needed a debt society to oppress me, you know that shit’s in our DNA. </p>
                     <p><span>JAYE</span>I’m not downplaying or belittling, I feel that too. I am just making the point - the same point you just made - that it is self enforced. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN<br /> (turns to face Jaye on the bench, staring as if she’s been slighted) </span></p>
                     <p><span>JAYE<br /> (anticipating this, and finally getting frustrated himself - a rarity) </span>Do you think it’s easy to be this easy-going? That it’s without truly all my effort? (puts both hands on table and stands up to leave)Thought you knew me better than that. </p>
                     <p><span>MAREN, with guilt, tries to form a sentence.</span></p>
                     <p><span>JAYE<br /> (walking towards his bedroom now, turns back to Maren) </span>Were you even going to ask about my mom? About anything? </p>
