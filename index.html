            <h3>“One of the functions of art is to give people the words to know their own experience. Storytelling is a
              tool for knowing who we are and what we want.” <br />- Ursula K. Le Guin</h3>
            <p>The stories we tell ourselves, about both our public and private pasts, determine so much of how we will
              show up for the present. How we interpret experiences has a profound impact on our capacity for both
              agency and compassion, and subsequently our personhood. The relationship between agency and victimhood is
              a nuanced one, and how we live our lives may be determined by the lens through which we view our own
              narrative and the ways in which we tell those stories.</p>
            <p>The narratives we construct around our own experiences not only constitute the deeply personal
              epistemological scaffolding which come to inform our worldviews, but also the lens through which we view
              that very world. The capacity to interpret, assimilate, and often cope with past experiences holds great
              bearing on the way in which we move through the present and what we are able to conceive as possible for
              the future. This has profound implications for both our individual and collective lives, and thus our
              ability to engage <a target="_blank"

                change</a> and sustained transformation on a societal level. In order to enact
              equitable, pluralistic, and reparative futures, we must first believe they are possible. In this effort,
              the importance in politicizing trauma<sup><a href="#forward-1">1</a></sup> is paramount given the immediate threat
              climate change
              and systemic violence pose to frontline communities<sup><a href="#forward-2">2</a></sup>. “Enacting Just Futures”
              examines urgent
              questions<sup><a href="#forward-3">3</a></sup> about the human condition in crisis through storytelling. “Enacting
              Just Futures”
              takes the form of a screenplay; a
              speculative and visionary fiction<sup><a href="#forward-4">4</a></sup> that seeks to empower adaptive
              agency<sup><a href="#forward-5">5</a></sup> in order
              to collectively enact a new world order<sup><a href="#forward-6">6</a></sup>. I use fiction as a means to
              challenge the
              relationships between
              crypto-colonialism<sup><a href="#forward-7">7</a></sup>,
              capitalism, and climate change that systematically subjugate communities that do not subscribe to their
              ideologies<sup><a href="#forward-8">8</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>A society’s capacity to usefully integrate tragic compassion<sup><a href="#forward-9">9</a></sup> as a structural
              tenet hinges
              upon
              philosopher Martha Nussbaum’s insight that “people are dignified agents, but they are also, frequently,
              victims”. That
              victimization, catalyzed by environmental degradation, will become rampant for millions<sup><a href="#forward-10">10</a></sup> as we
              enter an age
              of unprecedented insecurity<sup><a href="#forward-11">11</a></sup> in a truly anthropogenic era where no part of
              earth - whether
              directly or
              indirectly - has been untouched by the impact of mankind<sup><a href="#forward-12">12</a></sup>. In order for
              those most
              disenfranchised to be
              treated with dignity, the collective narrative for activists seeking to dismantle systems of oppression
              needs to shift from resilience<sup><a href="#forward-13">13</a></sup> to resistance - we cannot keep asking the
              same vulnerable
              communities to
              absorb the risks and costs of this crisis.</p>
            <h3>“Can we really not imagine anything better?”</h3>
            <p>This question was first posed to me last spring by <u>Collette Pichon Battle</u> in a lecture on
              Leadership in
              Environmental Conflicts. It is one that I have since envisioned as the call to action of my graduate
              studies; one that requires both a realistic assessment of current political and economic systems, and a
              radical revisioning of what they could be. Addressing this question as a society will require organized,
              empathic leadership that promotes purposeful experimentation and prioritizes a just and inclusive process.
              In order for this undertaking of transformative justice to be successful, we will not only need creative
              strategies and tactics, but public narratives that inspire action in the face of uncertainty--ones that
              inspire <b>hope</b>. Hope alongside grief, fear, and anger - because all of those things coexist. Collette
              Pichon
              Battle’s lecture highlighted the failures of our collective moral imagination that have perpetuated
              oppressive, hegemonic systems through complacency. We have not been living by the question - <em>can we
                not
                imagine anything better?</em></p>
            <p>We are surrounded by evidence of tremendous suffering, yet too often those with the ability to create
              positive change are complacent or impaired by empathic distress rather than striving to embody radical
              hope. I take inspiration from activist-scholars such as Rebecca Solnit, who reframe ideas of hope in terms
              of transformative solidarity that requires action. Transformative away from the status quo rather than
              reactionary and protective of it. This piece is about the self-work of interrogating our own narratives,
              ones where we may play the role of bystander or victim, to become agents of change for ourselves and our
              communities. Personal and societal transformation is inseparable. We need to build our capacity to hold
              that complexity while organizing together. Can modeling generative conflict through empathic storytelling
              lead to collective action? Imagined scenarios that invite readers to look beyond individual experience to
              interrogate the social, political, and economic roots of trauma<sup><a href="#forward-14">14</a></sup>? This piece
              attempts to build
              an imperfect
              world<sup><a href="#forward-15">15</a></sup> that we can not only hope for, but realistically work towards. We
              cannot move on to
              envisioning
              radically different social configurations and material flows without confronting the colonial legacies we
              inherited and perpetuate in the daily productions of our lives.</p>
            <h3>“Transform yourself to transform the world.”<br />- Grace Lee Boggs</h3>
            <p>My personal trauma and socialization have led me to believe that I am inherently <em>wrong</em>: my ideas
              are
              wrong, my emotions are wrong, my personhood is wrong. Invalid, irrelevant, unimportant. I put tremendous
              effort into believing that my opinions and emotions are equally as valid as those of the next person, but
              my depression and anxiety warn me otherwise. My unstable upbringing led to a belief that I am incapable of
              grasping concepts that seem obvious to everyone else around me; a belief which is amplified in settings
              where people are posturing and constantly claiming space (i.e. Harvard and Movement spaces in general).
              Taking up any amount of space feels dangerous to me, and sometimes when I speak my mind or assert a claim
              my body reacts as if I am in physical danger even if my mind knows better. Pragmatism and reparenting can
              only take me so far when I walk into a room not only believing these things about myself, but being
              convinced that every other person has the same assumption. I bring this up because this deep-seated fear
              has been a barrier to engaging with activism broadly. In part, I have not known what I have to offer; a
              sense of self doubt that has heightened in organizing spaces where burnout is high and patience is
              low<sup><a href="#forward-16">16</a></sup>.
              Spaces of resistance have sometimes felt just as siloed and exclusionary as academia. There is also a
              sense of self-sacrifice and martyrdom associated with committing one's life to the revolution that has
              further complicated my relationship with activism. What are the ways to find joy and the ability to be
              present despite a societal expectation that suffering is inherent to justice work and success?</p>
            <p>My views on this shifted after reading adrienne maree brown. Her latest book, Pleasure Activism: The
              Politics of Feeling Good, has convinced me that changing the world doesn’t just have to be another form of
              work, but rather can be regenerative, healing, and pleasurable. She posits that we settle for suffering
              and self-negation because of oppression; that oppression makes us believe that pleasure (for me, happiness
              without fear or shame) is not something that we all have equal access to. In order for activism to be
              sustainable, it must be generative, inclusive, and more than that, imaginative of a more just future which
              does not further replicate the fissures of the status quo. Movement should feel satisfying; a relationship
              between what we have to offer and what the Movement needs from us. Adrienne has taught me that misery and
              Movement shouldn’t feel synonymous. That is the sweet spot we should strive to occupy--the one that
              precludes the voice of doubt that tells us we have nothing to offer, or that what we have to offer isn’t
              enough. In order to find that sweet spot, we have to establish boundaries alongside our politicization and
              build our capacity for love and rigor <em>simultaneously</em><sup><a href="#forward-17">17</a></sup>. Logic alone
              doesn’t change
              behavior; an emotional
              call to action is necessary to push forward a new social philosophy. We cannot make moral decisions
              without emotional information - if we cannot experience emotion, we cannot experience values that orient
              us to the choices we must make<sup><a href="#forward-18">18</a></sup>. As Angela Davis says, “the revolution must
              be irresistible.”
            </p>
            <p>Cultivating self-knowledge is a prerequisite to empathy and living in community. Complexity of
              character<sup><a href="#forward-19">19</a></sup>
              and personhood is often flattened and made dichotomous by identity politics and the reductive nature of
              the roles we play (or that are assigned to us). Liberating ourselves from these identity traps is
              necessary in order to facilitate sustainable momentum in the face of crisis and injustice. This should
              happen through an individual and communal healing process that prioritizes those who have been
              generationally oppressed<sup><a href="#forward-20">20</a></sup>. Organizing for this movement should be a
              liberatory practice and an
              act of
              resistance that allows our visions and our values to align over time. ”Enacting Just Futures” seeks to
              play a
              role in collectively growing our capacity for hope in order to organize against further oppression and
              cultivate communities of care.</p>
            <h3>“There is nothing radical about moral clarity”<br />Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</h3>
            <p>In order to craft the screenplay as a call-to-action for enacting just futures, I looked to the framework
              and organizing principles of the Green New Deal (GND)<sup><a href="#forward-21">21</a></sup>. Over the past 2
              years we have
              witnessed the
              unveiling of equitable and inclusive climate policy in the form of the GND, spearheaded in the states by
              Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/green-new-deal"
                target="_blank">The Sunrise Movement</a> and by many others abroad.</p>
            <p>The GND is a departure from previous climate policy in that it addresses the roles of multiple systems
              and institutions in creating and perpetuating the global climate crisis. It assigns blame
              directly<sup><a href="#forward-22">22</a></sup> and
              provides adaptable paths forward<sup><a href="#forward-23">23</a></sup> against incrementalism, austerity, and
              concentrated wealth
              and ownership.
              It explicitly rejects logics of perpetual growth and extraction that are ingrained in the foundational
              institutions and practices that determine how wealth is produced and distributed. It acknowledges that
              moving beyond market fundamentalism will require deep structural shifts - not only in how the economy is
              organized, but in what is perceived as possible in the dominant social imaginary.</p>
            <p>I believe in a necessarily radical global Green New Deal. <em>Radical</em> in its <u>swift</u> and
              dramatic departure
              from business-as-usual and in its recognizing (and uplifting) the undervalued labor of care<sup><a href="#forward-24">24</a></sup>.
              With COVID-19
              and state efforts to ‘return to normal’, we are living through a historic moment that has exposed clearly
              that ‘normal’ for most of the global population is a constant state of crisis. It has exposed the politics
              of preordained inequality and predatory economics that have so tragically exacerbated not only the
              coronavirus crisis, but every pre existing inextricable crisis that undergirds it.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 presents an awakening from the hypnosis of normality. Isolation during the pandemic has felt
              like the eye of a storm at times. A familiar vantage point as someone who grew up in Florida with
              hurricanes rather than snow days in my childhood. That calm window presents an opportunity to assess the
              damage while awaiting the storm’s imminent, unstoppable second wave. The next wave is on our horizon, and
              the impacts of systemic breakdown in the midst of this pandemic are incomprehensible without storytelling.
              We are in the eye of a storm. Will we succumb to an insidious ethos of individualism, or forge new
              trajectories of connection and support?

          <p>The self is constructed by our experiences, and thus our trauma. So much of how I situate myself in my
            life, but especially in academia and spaces of activism, is tied up in embodied survival strategies that
            determine how I react in moments of uncertainty. Some reactions are so embedded that they are impossible to
            see; we are blinded by our own subjectivity. I look to Movement leader Staci K. Haines’ definition of trauma
            as it resonates most clearly with my own experiences and the false tradeoffs trauma presents. “Trauma is an
            experience, series of experiences, and/or impacts from social conditions, that break or betray our inherent
            need for safety, belonging, and dignity. They are experiences that result in us having to vie between these
            inherent needs, often setting one against the other. For example, it might leave us with the impact of “I
            can be safe but not connected (isolated),” or “I have to give up my dignity to be safe or connected.” This
            is untenable, because all of these needs are constitutive or inherent in us.” Haines, Staci. <em>The

          <p>Nussbaum looks to Greek tragedies to explain the development of compassion through lessons on the
            connection of common humanity. My simple interpretation: bad things happen to good people. Those bad things
            can never strip a person of their humanity and dignity. Nussbaum’s compassion requires discernment -
            “Tragedy asks us, then, to walk a delicate line. We are to acknowledge that life’s miseries strike deep,
            striking to the heart of human agency itself. And yet we are also to insist that they do not remove
            humanity, that the capacity for goodness remains when all else has been removed.” This false binary between
            agent and victim is a hallmark of American life. Nussbaum, Martha C. Upheavals of Thought : The Intelligence

          <p>Forced migration due to violence, land degradation/loss of livelihood, and climate change are examples of
            sociocultural and climatic events that leave their physical and psychological marks on places and the
            individuals who endure them. They are not only collective traumas but cumulative traumas in that they have
            detrimental and additive impacts on one’s mental and physical wellbeing over time. Displacement is not in
            the future. It is the reality for <a

            worldwide. For so
            many families a shifting climate is what uproots their lives. Whether indirectly through land degradation,
            desertification, and job and resource scarcity (or designed scarcity rather) or more explicitly through acts
            of violence, severe weather events, environmental racism, and land grabbing. Most of these refugees (58%)
            are not in camps or rural areas, but rather in cities(where the hell did i find this??). With capitalism in
            direct opposition to the climate, these trends will only increase. In fact, although the most widely cited
            estimate for global climate refugees by 2050 is <a href="https://www.iom.int/migration-and-climate-change\"

          <p>By impact of mankind I am not only referring to anthropogenic emissions from extractive projects, but
            particularly insidious anthropocentric mentalities. Ones that I believe long predate what some scholars deem
            the onset of the Anthropocene, such as the Industrial Revolution or the Great Acceleration. I align with Zoe
            Todd and Heather Davis’ definition and timeline of the new epoch which integrates indigenous knowledges:
            “The Anthropocene is not a new event, but is rather the continuation of practices of dispossession and
            genocide, coupled with a literal transformation of the environment, that have been at work for the last five
            hundred years.” Davis, Heather, and Zoe Todd. “On the Importance of a Date, or, Decolonizing the
            Anthropocene.” ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies 16, no. 4 (December 20, 2017):

          <p>Resistance over resilience. To borrow from urban ecologist Maria Kaika, a new paradigm in an old framework
            can only act as immunology. She, like many, is skeptical of development goals as a means to ensure
            socio-environmental equality. Kaika specifically calls out recurrent concepts, such as <b>resilience</b>, as
            attributes to be allocated and which “fail - by design - to address questions related to the conditions that
            made it necessary for people and environments to seek resilience in the first place.” Kaika, M., and Urban

              Deal</a> (and even more for a
            global Green New Deal). In short, it is a climate proposal that seeks to rapidly decarbonize the economy
            while dismantling racial, class, and gender inequalities. It envisions doing so by creating millions of jobs
            which prioritize disenfranchised communities while ensuring universal public services like Medicare for All,
            free education through college and free childcare. For the sake of brevity, I will quote my favorite
            long-view explanation: “We hope that confronting climate change will also be the occasion for breaking from
            capitalism. We see the Green New Deal, like its namesake, less as a particular suite of policies than as a
            multi-decade effort to write a more humane, sustainable, and democratic social contract. But whereas the New
            Deal ultimately saved capitalism for capitalists, we aspire to channel a new wave of mass mobilisation in a
            more radical direction.” “For a Global Green New Deal.” Accessed May 3, 2020.

            <span>GROUND LEVEL SHOT of two teenagers from behind, wading through shin deep water - one in shorts, one
              with already soaked rolled up jeans. Each is carrying a child’s blow up innertube over their shoulder, one
              with a six pack of beer. Trash sparsely populates the water which is glistening with oil and runoff. In
              front of them, a narrow patch of the water is bubbling as if over rapids, but really this is the area of
              Domino Park with run-through water jets for kids to cool off in during grueling summers like this one. The
              rainbow lights from the jets are creating iridescent currents with the oil. There had been heavy rain for
              the past three days that had finally let up. The high tide came with the full moon making the flooding
              even worse. A huge red orb illuminating the whole haunting scene.</span>
            <span>The teens find a spot beneath one of the gantry lifts and post up. The boy takes off his belt and uses
              it to attach the two innertubes together in case a current comes along while the girl secures their
              backpacks on a brace at the base of the crane. They plop down fully clothed into their innertubes, each
              crack a beer, and cheers. MUSIC FADES LOWER.</span>

              Things happened so much faster than anyone anticipated (beat) climatically, politically. The acceleration

              ACCEPTS BOTH OFFERINGS WITH FEIGN ANNOYANCE. This was a long time tradition, but she hadn’t seen JAYE in a
              decade so there was something that still felt a little rusty and forced in their interactions, at least
              that’s how her anxiety was telling her to feel. JAYE clearly is on another track and picks up right where
              they had left off without missing a beat. He had this ease about him in general, but especially with
              MAREN. Nothing made him uncomfortable.</span>

              in haste before her arrival. She walks over to the mirror and peers at herself, expressionless. She hasn’t
              seen herself in some time. She looks just like -</span>

            <span>FLASHBACK:</span>
            <span>INT. SINGLE-WIDE TRAILER - MINDEN, WV - 2028</span>
            <span>We see Maren’s mother, Jules, again. The single-wide is one long open room save the bedroom and a
              small bathroom with iron stained sink and toilet from the (then unknown) poisoned well water. It’s clear
              someones been sleeping on the sofa. Jules is in the small linoleum kitchen and something is burning in the
              oven - we don’t hear her but can tell she’s cursing, aggrieved. She burns herself taking it out and throws
              it in the sink, turns on the water and steam rushes up, mixing with smoke from oven. Man stomps in from
              back room and yells; Jules yells back. Young Maren sits at the small kitchen table and does homework
              through this, clearly used to the scene. The silence indicates her ability to block it out
              entirely.</span>
            <span>Over the shoulder shot of Maren doing her homework on the basics of how the climate is changing and
              what that means for Appalachia. This is now a standard part of curricula even in the South. Jules’ hand
              comes into the shot and rests on Maren’s shoulder. She turns to look and -</span>
            <span>CUT TO:</span>
            <span>Night time view. Maren’s POV - she’s the one that’s been sleeping on the couch which directly faces
              that pink vinyl door. She stares at it. A different man from the previous scene stumbles into view from
              back room and looks at Maren drunkenly, menacingly. She quickly closes her eyes to pretend she’s asleep.
              With them, the camera CUTS TO BLACK.</span>
            <span>OVER BLACK:</span>
            <span>We hear him stumble out the door, zippo light a cigarette, and start taking a piss right
              outside.</span>

            <span>CLOSE IN ON JULES’ back, LYING IN BED from MAREN’S POV. They are in the small bedroom of the trailer.
              Dark except for the light from the TV, washing mother and daughter indigo. JULES coughs and shivers, MAREN
              lies behind her, a little big spoon with space between. She scratches her mom’s back to comfort her.
              Unclear if she’s sick or going through withdrawals. Perhaps both.</span>

            <span>
              MAREN CLOSING DOOR as she leaves the bedroom. We see the rest of the COOP. It’s clear this place is
              well-loved. MAREN’S
              and 6 other rooms are situated on a U-shaped mezzanine level that looks over the communal space. It has a
              small library
              of worn books and couches on one side with an assortment of instruments and amps. SHE WALKS TO THE RAILING
              and looks
              down onto a half dozen other flatmates celebrating in the kitchen. The space is animated with gratitude
              for this moment.
              Genuine connection is obvious, this is a chosen family.
            </span>
            <span>CUT TO:</span>
            <span>INT. LARGE INDUSTRIAL COOP KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE</span>
            <span>
              “Range Life” plays on, but the source switches to a record player. The space itself feels alive between
              the excitement
              in the air and the humid stretch and expansion of the building materials on this spring day. The season
              had actually
              come “on time” this year, if they were going by 20th century standards. There were even mushrooms
              sprouting near the
              sink; not the best sign but a sign of life nonetheless. There was a large, operable window wall that
              opened like a fan
              onto a view of the communal courtyard, framed with young Oak trees. The neighbors were already celebrating
              and their joy
              was drifting in through the open windows, making the whole scene feel like a collective living room.
              Having missed a
              decade of this city, we get her first smile. This is her first encounter with collective hope of this
              measure. The
              extent to which Brooklyn has prioritized frontline communities and rapidly adapted without compromising
              joy pulls her
              out of her fog.

            <span>CUT TO HISTORICAL MONTAGE</span>
            <span>The transition was anything but easy given the Senate’s Republican majority and the then dominant
              historic bloc’s hegemony (SHOWN THROUGH ALT RIGHT PROTESTS AND VIOLENCE). At that point Fascism was
              spreading faster than the unprecedented wildfires, but the Labor Movement was growing as well - just out
              of the spotlight(SHOWN THROUGH SHOTS OF ACTIVISTS ORGANIZING, UNION MEETINGS). Of course in the end it
              wasn’t the crises or consensus that forced the establishment’s hand so much as a rupture in collective
              thought and action (IMAGES OF MASS MOBILIZATION WORLDWIDE) - a mass movement that both of Maren’s adopted
              fathers were and still are deeply involved in (CLOSE IN ON MAREN’S FATHERS MARCHING, viewers don’t know
              them or their significance yet).</span>
            <span>While their generation inherited the implementation of inclusive, ecosocialist policies, they also
              inherited the hail marys of technocrats and corporate executives clinging to their power through carbon
              capture and geo engineering. The haze was just lifting from the sulfides they’d released into the
              stratosphere when Maren and Jaye were in middle school (SHOW JETS SPRAYING AEROSOL INJECTIONS IN
              STRATOSPHERE; SHOW SUBTLY DIFFERENT, BUT EERIE ATMOSPHERE). The health implications being what some
              pundits described as no worse than what we already had coming. Maybe for some...</span>

            <span>Over five decades after polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from electrical equipment manufactured for
              the coal industry contaminated the soil and water sources (SHOTS OF ARBUCKLE CREEK). Initial PCB
              contamination from local Shafer Equipment Company (SHOTS OF SHAFER AND 8 LOCAL MINES CLOSED) was the
              source of cancer clusters.</span>

              sampling and testing to fully define any remaining contamination”

              “They talk a good talk, but let’s see if they’re going to do what they say because I don’t believe
              nothing. The EPA has failed us three or four times and lied to us. They didn’t do nothing for us.”

              <span>MINDEN RESIDENT 2 (V.O.)</span>
              “I really don’t see an effort from the government to get anybody out. They’ll just wait and let everybody
              die out like they have been doing.”

            <span>Images of younger, healthier Jules protesting in front of old Shafer Site, pushing to have Minden
              declared the 11th Superfund site in her state. This was before over 100 people in a town of roughly 250
              were also diagnosed with cancer. 1 in 4 Americans live within 4 miles (by some estimates 3) of a Superfund
              site.</span>

              either side of her; their affect warm, her’s icy. Shots of empty Minden - people had finally been
              relocated via a government buyout. A bittersweet victory. It was one of the first towns under ______ Act
              that required and supervised the clean up of the contamination, but this was little consolation in a young
              Maren’s mind when she lost both her mother and her home to ______________.</span>
